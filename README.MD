  This tool allows you to set GTA 5's priority while it's starting up, without having to fiddle around with the Task Manager.

  Neat huh?
</p>

### How do I use it?
1. Double-click it to run.
2. It'll ask you to run it as an administrator. Click yes.
3. Select the priority level you want to use. **(Recommended: High)**
4. Click OK, then run GTA 5.

You can run the tool after starting up GTA 5 too, the app will automatically find its process, and set the priority for you.
